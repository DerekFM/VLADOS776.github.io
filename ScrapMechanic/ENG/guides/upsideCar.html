<h1>How to make a upside-down car</h1>
<h2>How can you not get nervous from your car flipping over and you had to fill up a place in your inventory with the lift? SAY NO MORE! This is the guide for you. Here you can learn how to build a simple car that, when it flips over, under the press of a button, you can ride it UPSIDE DOWN!</h2>

<h3><span>The Basics</span></h3>
<p>First, you will need this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipe Short</li>
<li>Pipe Corner</li>
<li>Bearings</li>
<li>Any Kind Of Block</li>
<li>Engine</li>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>Driver Seat</li>
<li>Big Wheels</li>
<li>Switch</li>
</ul>

<p>So, how do you do this?<br>
Well, first you will ned to build the car itself</p>

<p>1) Build a 6x4 platform</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/1.jpg">
<p>2) Now, add the bearings</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/2.jpg">
<p>3) Add a pipe on each bearing, and put another one</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/3.jpg">
<p>4) For the front wheels, add a pipe corner and then 5 pipes for each wheel</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/4.jpg">
<p>5) Now, add pipe corners like this, using bearings after the first pipe corner</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/5.jpg">
<p>6) Finally, put some bearings and the wheels and the front is done</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/6.jpg">
<p>7) The back wheels are easier, just add a pipe corner on each bearing</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/7.jpg">
<p>8) Now add 5 short pipes on each part</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/8.jpg">
<p>9) Add a pipe corner, a bearing and a wheel </p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/9.jpg">
<p>10) Finally, place an engine and it's done! (Place it wherever you want it) (Just the normal car is done, not the whole car)</p>
<p>At the end, this is how the wheels should be placed on the car (let's call it a "space view").</p>

<h3><span>The "Mechanic" Part</span></h3>
<p>WARNING! BEFORE YOU READ THIS, MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS JUST A SPACE VIEW OF THE CAR, NOT HOW THE ACTUAL CAR WILL LOOK</p>
<p>10) Now for the actual "mechanic" part, add a controller and 2 switches. You can put them wherever you want, but i prefer to put them like this, just for the style.<br>
Now, connect one of them (it doesnt matter which one) to the controller.</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/12.jpg">
<p>11) Add a driver seat, and connect the switch to the driver seat</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/13.jpg">
<p>12) Connect the controller to ONE set of bearings, like in the photo</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/14.jpg">
<p>13) Place another controller and connect it to the other set of bearings<br>
Don't forget to connect the other switch to this controller</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/15.jpg">
<p>14) This is the angle settings for the new placed controller</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/16.jpg">
<p>15) And this is for the old-placed controller</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/17.jpg">
<p>16) Now, connect the switches to the driver seat, the driver seat to the engine and the front horizontal bearings (like in the photo below)</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/18.jpg">

<h3><span>The Tutorial</span></h3>
<p>WARNING! The text below depends on the order of the switches connected to the driver seat</p>

<p>Now, this should be you car</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/19.jpg">
<p>The switches part is easy, the first button (in my order of connecting the switches) makes the wheel go up (or down if you are flipped over)<br>
It should look like this:</p>
<img src="../../guides-img/car/20.jpg">
<p>(If it doesn't look like this, make sure you followed each step correctly)</p>

<p>You may wonder what the second button does? Well, if you didn't press the first switch, it will just raise up the driver seat. If you did pres the first button first, It will just raisen up the driver seat with 15 degrees more.</p>
