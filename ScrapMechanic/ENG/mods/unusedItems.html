This mod doesn't actually add anything new to the game, it just shows hidden objects that are currently in the code, but they are unused. These hidden unused objects will reappear in your creative inventory if you install this mod. Here are the hidden items that this mod re-adds: - Indestructible Block - Insulation Block - Spaceship Block - Round Light - LED Light - Big LED Light - Aircon - Battery - Ink Ammo Note that none of these items were created by us, but were all created by the creators of Scrap Mechanic. We did not invent any of these new items. They were already in the game, but were only hidden from the user. Installing this mod makes the items appear in your inventory. Many of these new items are likely to appear in future Scrap Mechanic versions, since the game is currently only in Beta still.</p>
